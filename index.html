                    <h2>Congratulations to all!</h2>
                    <p>Two weeks after Bayern Munich won the UEFA Champions League, former captain Philipp Lahm gave an analysis of the success of the Gray Lobster in the last season, about the format of the UEFA Champions League during the period. difficulties… and predict the team's ability to dominate in the coming years.</p>

                    <h2>These players shape and command the game</h2>
                    <p>These players shape and command the game, making a decisive influence. Besides, they are complemented by young players with big aspirations who will do everything to become the face of the next generation of FC Bayern: Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka. Their drive and aspirations are unmistakable and promising.Plus, talented players who, in their individual abilities, are always on fire – remember Alphonso Davies' solo against Barcelona or Serge Gnabry's superb goal against Lyon.Each of the above players is in his right position and does his job right. Coaches know it and make it happen.FC Bayern still has a reputation and appeal at home, in part because of its history. FC Bayern is a magnet for the top German players of their generation. It creates an identity for its players and also for the fans.</p>

                    <p>Many people enjoy this format with its instant excitement and speed – just one match, you advance or you are eliminated. However, I think the Champions League, as we've known it for years, needs to reflect the quality of the teams involved.The format of the tournament changes with the times. Even the nature of the tournament is constantly changing. The highlights of a season - the encounters of the top clubs - are packed into a week. </p>

                    <h2>Establishing hierarchy</h2>
                    <p>The coach has put his trust in a system of experienced players – above all, it is Manuel Neuer in the woodwork. In front of him were Jerome Boateng and David Alaba, who had played for FC Bayern for many years, knowing the game as well as brimming with confidence. Front and center is Thomas Mueller and at the top is Robert Lewandowski, who is at the peak of his career and can score almost whenever he wants. At home, the next titles are almost certain. Internationally,there are still 6-7 other clubs that can claim the title. I don't see a team that is completely superior and will dominate this race for many years to come.</p>

                    <p>The most important reason can be summed up very succinctly: Hansi Flick has established the existing system within the team with just a few changes. This measure was successful from the start and became more and more perfect in the following matches. </p>
